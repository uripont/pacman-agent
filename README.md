# Pacman Agent

A template for coding a pacman agent.

## Quickstart

Clone the repository using "--recursive" to include contest submodules:

```bash
git clone --recursive <repository-url>
```

You can quickly set up and run a contest match using the provided scripts. They use `uv` to manage a virtual environment and dependencies, and handle the contest setup.

```bash
scripts/config.sh
scripts/play.sh
```
